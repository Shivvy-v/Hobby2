    My favourite hobbies are to go swimming, sing, go for walks, and to hula-hoop. While going for walks, I enjoy singing. Singing while going for walks is my favorite pastime and my hobby because it's not just the walks I love, but also way I learn to express my feelings. I have many hobbies, but I also like swimming. Swimming usually gets my mind off of things, and can help me relax. I usualy enjoy doing my hobby with my family because they keep me company and they can be fun to socialize with.By swimming, I get better at concentration because swimming has been a way that I let out any stress from time to time.<Br/><Br/> Since the pandemic, I haven't been able to go for a swim, so I manage to keep myslef at peace by hula-hooping. Hula-hoopiing is a fun hobby of mine. A hoola-hoop is a large hoop/ring that you put around your waist and shake. The point of this is trying not to let the hoop touch the ground. You can do many digfferent tricks with a hoola hoop!
